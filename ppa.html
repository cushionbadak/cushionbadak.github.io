                    Description
                    <ul><li>
                        SweepFlow can fix wrong C++ program that doesn't meet some test cases,
                        if the given C++ program wrote variable incorrectly.
                        The brute force solution has O(n*m) complexity for n variables and m code-points where the variable appears,
                        and we solved this problem faster using machine learning.

                    Motivation
                    <ul><li>
                        At algorithm problem-solving website (e.g. codeforces.com),
                        we found that some users are struggling with correct their variable misused code.
                        This kind of error is trivial but the debugging is time-consuming.
                    </li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    We used the LLVM Clang library and machine learning to deal with this problem.
                    I mainly contributed to dealing with the C++ code(parsing, find scopes, ...) using the LLVM Clang library.
                    Jisung Hong mainly contributed to collect benchmark codes from codeforces.com, and write machine learning parts to speculate which code-points are likely to be wrong.
